# Emoji Search Demo Project

Practice React (with functional components!) by completing this skeleton project. 

You will find most of the structure already built out, you just need to add some finishing touches with your mad skills.

# Usage
1. Fork the repository, or just clone it directly with `git clone https://github.com/elliott-king/emoji-search.git`
2. Install all dependencies with `yarn install`.
3. Run it with `yarn run`.

There are quite a few things missing. You can look through the code for TODOs, but here is a quick rundown:
- the filter in `filterEmoji` is not very comprehensive
- you will need to handle the input in `SearchInput`
- create some `EmojiResultRows` in the `EmojiResultsConatiner`
- some components will need more props

You __do not__ need to:
- touch the json file
- modify the CSS (but your result will look better if you use its rules)

Feel free to look at the [completed site](https://elliott-king.github.io/emoji-search/). There is also a solution branch if you need it.

# Background

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is heavily adapted from one of the [example React apps](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search), but it uses functional components.

I have been given a few React code challenges, so I figured I would try to build a code challenge myself.

# Possible extensions:
 - filter by keyboard section (people, flags, symbols, etc.)
 - add an option to change skin tone
